This is a website to book a match for a futsal game for an hour. First you need to register with your full name,
email, contact and password to enter then login your account with email and password to book a game. I have prepared 3
branches in 3 different places for people's convenient. They can login and book the day they want to play in their
chosen place and also book the time as they wish to come and play, and then they will conform it and in database a new
user will be added. After that owner gets a mail with the costumer information saying a new request then the owner
conform or deny. Then it changes in the database with true(1) but if it denied then it will remain false(0).
